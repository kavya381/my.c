1. Starting Point
When you run a C program, the execution begins with the main() function.

It is required in every C program (except for very low-level or embedded system programs with custom entry points).

2. Controls Program Flow
The main() function typically contains or calls other functions that perform the actual tasks of the program.

It orchestrates the overall logic and flow of execution.

3. Returns a Status Code
The main() function usually has a return type of int.

It returns a value to the operating system to indicate success (0) or failure (non-zero).

Edit
int main() {
    // program code
    return 0; // indicates success
}
4. Can Accept Arguments (Optional)
main() can also take arguments: int argc, char *argv[], allowing it to handle command-line input.

c
Copy
Edit
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // argc: argument count
    // argv: argument vector (array of strings)
}
Summary:
The main() function is essential because it:

Marks where execution begins.

Organizes and manages program execution.

Optionally returns a status to the system.

Can accept command-line arguments for flexible input.

Without main(), the compiler doesnâ€™t know where to begin running your code.
